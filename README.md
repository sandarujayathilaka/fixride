# FIXRIDE

FIXRIDE is a mobile application designed for drivers to locate nearby garages when their vehicles break down. This app also enables garage owners to expand their customer base and grow their business. The system includes three portals: User, Mechanic, and Garage Owner. Drivers can use the app to request assistance from an available garage in the area, and garage owners can then assign a mechanic through the app. Once assigned, the mechanic travels to the customer's location to perform the necessary repairs and updates the case status using their portal.
